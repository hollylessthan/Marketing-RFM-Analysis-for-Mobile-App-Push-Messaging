# The two approaches yield the same RFM index for 17594 customers but different RFM indexes for 10284 customers.
# 
# The independent RFM makes the interpretation of each of the three RFM components easily understood. For instance, a frequency score of 5 for one customer with a recency rank of 5 means the same as a frequency score of 5 for another customer with a recency rank of 3. However, for smaller samples, this method will probably generate a less even distribution of combined RFM scores.
# 
# The sequential RFM provides a more even distribution of RFM scores than the independent RFM. However, its frequency and monetary rank scores are more difficult to interpret than those of the independent RFM. For example, a frequency rank of 5 for a customer with a recency rank of 5 may not mean the same thing as a frequency rank of 5 for a customer with a recency rank of 4 because the frequency rank is dependent on the recency rank.

# ### 11.	The answer to question 9 assumes a single breakeven response rate that applies across all cells. Redo your analysis for sequential RFM based on a breakeven response rate calculated for each RFM cell.
# 
# > Note: To project the expected profits for the remaining customers not part of the sample you can use Tuangoâ€™s standard fee and the ordersize number you calculated for question 2.
